# Aer Browser - Development Decisions Log

## Session 2025-09-02 06:38 - 07:00

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Repository Setup** âœ…
   - Created GitHub repository: https://github.com/bkwebster/aer-browser-v2
   - Established proper version control and session tracking
   - **Decision**: Use Git for all progress tracking to prevent session loss

2. **Browser Architecture Approach** ðŸ”„
   - **Tried**: Iframe approach (rejected - not a real browser)
   - **Tried**: Separate Tauri webview windows (current issue - creates popup windows)
   - **Decision**: Must implement TRUE CEF embedding within main Tauri window
   - **Reasoning**: We want a real browser, not a simulator

3. **Frontend Approach** âœ… **CONFIRMED**
   - **Decision**: Keep React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS frontend
   - **Reasoning**: UI looks beautiful and provides great developer experience
   - **Status**: Working perfectly - address bar, navigation, smart URL handling

4. **Database Strategy** ðŸ“‹ **PLANNED**
   - **Decision**: SQLite over DuckDB for better Tauri integration
   - **Long-term**: Plan for authentication and cross-device sync
   - **Features**: History, bookmarks, tab persistence, user sessions

### Current Problem Statement

**Issue**: Separate window creation instead of embedded browsing
- Main "Aer" window shows React UI but goes white on navigation
- URLs create separate "Browser Content" window with actual web content
- **Root cause**: Using `WebviewWindowBuilder` creates separate windows, not embedded views

**Target**: Single window with embedded web content
- Web pages should load in the content area of the main Aer window
- No separate popups or secondary windows
- True browser experience within one unified interface

### Next Research Focus

**Primary Goal**: Implement TRUE CEF integration
1. Research `tauri-apps/cef-rs` for embedded CEF within Tauri windows
2. Find proper API for embedding Chromium engine in existing window
3. Ensure full browser features (cookies, storage, user agents, etc.)
4. Maintain React UI for browser chrome/controls

**Success Criteria**:
- âœ… Single window application
- âœ… Web content renders in main window content area  
- âœ… Full browser engine capabilities (not web-based limitations)
- âœ… Native performance and security model

### Technical Notes

- Tauri 2.0 API differences from examples found online
- `WebviewBuilder` may require unstable features
- CEF integration appears to be the correct path for real browser functionality
- Current React UI architecture is solid and should be preserved

### User Feedback Integration

- User frustrated with separate windows (rightfully so!)
- Emphasis on wanting "real browser" not "simulator" 
- UI appearance praised - keep visual design
- Need persistent session tracking (addressed with Git repo)

## Decision Impact

This session established the foundation but identified the core architectural challenge. The next phase must focus entirely on proper CEF embedding to achieve the true browser experience the user wants.
